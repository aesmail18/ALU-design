# ALU-design


In this project, we attempt to design and build an ALU "Arithmetic-Logic Unit".

What is an arithmetic-logic unit (ALU)? An arithmetic-logic unit is part of a central processing unit that carries out arithmetic and logic operations on the operands in computer instruction words. In some processors, the ALU is divided into two units: an arithmetic unit (AU) and a logic unit (LU).

The central processing unit (CPU) is the core of a computer system and consists of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and the control unit. The ALU can come in a variety of configurations from a single simple unit, up to extremely complex units that perform complex operations.
